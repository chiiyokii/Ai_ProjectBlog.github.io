**Here is a quick glance about what we plan to do :**

&emsp;We love art, especially pictures and paintings. That’s why our project focuses on developing an AI able to distinguish a painting from a photograph.
Our plan is to use a dataset containing both real photos and paintings. The primary goal is to create a binary classification system to differentiate them (for example, using ‘1’ for a real photo and ‘0’ for a painting). Then, we will mix the dataset and train the AI accordingly. Although we haven’t decided yet which programming language or library to use, we are aware that we will be working with image files. Therefore, we need a solution that can adapt to different image sizes and resolutions, we plan to put all the images at the same size.


Dataset from kaggle we will use : [DatasetOfPhotosAndPaintings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iiplutocrat45ii/painting-vs-photograph-classification-dataset)
