**Here is a quick glance about what we plan to do :**

&emsp;We like art. Especially pictures and paintings. That is why our project is about an AI with the ability to distinguish between a painting and a photo. 
We plan to use a dataset containing real photos and paintings. The main goal would be to use a binary notation to differentiate the real photos and the paintings (example: ‘1’ for a real picture and ‘0’ for a painting). Then mix the dataset and train the AI.
As of now, we have not decided what programming language or library we plan to use. However, we know that the nature of the files we will work with are images. Meaning that we'll need something that adapts with every change of size and picture definition.

Dataset from kaggle we plan to use :
