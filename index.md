**Here is a quick glance about what we plan to do :**

&emsp;We love art, especially pictures and paintings. That’s why our project focuses on developing an AI that can distinguish between a painting and a photograph.
Our plan is to use a dataset containing both real photos and paintings. The primary goal is to create a binary classification system to differentiate between the two (for example, using ‘1’ for a real photo and ‘0’ for a painting). After that, we will mix the dataset and train the AI accordingly. We haven’t yet decided which programming language or library to use, but we are aware that we will be working with image files. Therefore, we need a solution that can adapt to different image sizes and resolutions.
